CodeIgniter Template Library
============================

A Template library for [CodeIgniter] [4], by [Alexander Baldwin] [1] and
licensed under your choice of either the [MIT] [2] or [GPL] [3] open source
licenses.

It enables you to organise multiple views from multiple themes into complex,
nested sections and provide each one of those with seperate data, choosing
whether to allow that data to propagate to child sections. These sections can be
grouped, iterated and linked, with automatic embedding within one another to
create a fully functioning, yet modular, page.

Enjoy!
