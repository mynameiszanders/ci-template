CodeIgniter Template Library
============================

A Template library for [CodeIgniter] [4], by [Alexander Baldwin] [1] and
licensed under your choice of either the [MIT] [2] or [GPL] [3] open source
licenses.

The CodeIgniter Template library enables you to organise multiple views
into complex, nested sections providing each one with seperate data sets,
controlling data propagation. These sections can be grouped, iterated and
linked with automatic embedding to create a fully functioning, yet modular,
page.

To read more about this library, please refer to the [online copy of the user guide] [5].

Enjoy!
